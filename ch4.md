## 42. passive被动(is done/ was done)



主动（active）:

> It's a big company. **It employs** two hundred people.

被动：

> **Two hundred people are employed** by the company.

当我们使用被动形态时，这个东西是由谁或者什么东西造成的变成了未知或者不重要。如果要表达的话，用**by**。

---

被动使用 **be** + **过去分词**.

## 44.被动3

`offer`,`give`,`ask`,`pay`,`show`,`teach`,`tell`等单词拥有2个对象（或者说是2个名词），它们的主动形态句子有2中方式：

> **The police** were given the information.
>
> **The information** was given to the police.

他们的被动形式一般由人来开头：

> **I've been offered** the job, but I don't think I'll accept it.

---

**doing**的被动 **being done**:

> I don't like **people telling me** what to do.
>
> I don't like **being told** what do do.

---

在被动语态中，**get**可以用来替代**be**.

> There was a flight at the party, but nobody **got hurt**. (= nobody **was** hurt)

但是**get**只用在事情发生的时候，比如下列情况不能用get：

> Jessica **is liked** by everybody. (not get liked - this is not a 'happending')
>
> Peter was a mystery man. Very little **was known** about him.

**get**用在非正式的口语中，**be**可用在所有的情况下。

**get**还可以这么用（没有被动的意思）：

> get married, get divorced
>
> get dressed (= put on your clothes)
>
> get lost (= not know where you are)
>
> get changed (= change your clothes)

 ## 45. It is said that...  He is said to ... He is supposed to ...

> **It is said that** he is 108 years old.
>
> **He is said to be** 108 years old.

同样的还有以下单词:

`alleged`,`believed`,`considered`,`expected`,`known`,`reported`,`thought`,`understood`.

> The police are looking for a missing boy. **It is believed that** the boy is wearing a white sweater and blue jeans.
>
> The boy **is believed to be wearing** a white sweater and blue jeans.

> The strike started three weeks ago.**It is expected that** the strike will end soon.
>
> The strike **is expected to end** soon.

这种形式经常用在报道中：

> **It is reported that** two people were injured in the explosion.
>
> Two people **are reported to have been injured** in the explosion.

---

有时候**supposed to**  = said to

> I want to see that film. It**'s supposed to be** good. (= it is said to be good)

但是有时候**supposed to**有不同的意思。我们用它表示intented,arranged,expected。它经常和实际的情况不同。

> The plan **is supposed to be** a secret, but everybody seems to know about it. (= the plan is intended to be a secret)
>
> What are you doing at work? you**'re supposed to be** on holiday. (= you arranged to be on holiday)

You're **not supposed to** do something 有不被允许和建议的意思：

> You**'re not supposed to park** your car here. It's private parking only.
>
> Jeff is much better after his illness, but he**'s** still **not supposed to do** any heavy work.	

## 46 Have something done

> Lisa **had** the roof **repaired** yesterday.

Lisa叫人把房顶修好了，而不是Lisa自己修的。

**have something done**表示我们安排某人为我们做事情

> Lisa **repaired** the roof. (= she repaired it herself)
>
> Lisa **had** the roof **repaired**. (= she arranged for somebody else to repair it)

一定要注意单词的顺序， 过去分词要在宾语后面。

---

可以用**get something done**来替代**have something done**

> When are you going to **get the roof repaired**?

---

有时候**have something done**有不同的意思。

> Paul and Karen **had their bags stolen** while they were travelling.

这里**have something done**表示某件事情发生在某人身上，一般的都是坏事。
