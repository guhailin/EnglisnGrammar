---

多个*fact adjectvies*的使用顺序：

---

**Fast/hard/late**

注意**Lately**不是**late**的副词:

> Have you seen Tom **lately**?

---

**hardly**不是**hard**的副词。**hardly**的各种有用法。

> She **hardly** spoke to me.

I **can hardly** do something = 对我来说说做某件事很困难，几乎完成不了。

## 102. So and such

**so**和**such**的比较。

**so**后面跟形容词或副词：

> so stupid
>
> so quick
>

**such**后面跟名词：

---

**so**和**such**都加强所要表达的意思。

> It's a beautiful day, isn't it? It's **so warm**.
>
> It was a great holiday. We had **such a good time**.

可以用**so ...that**  和 **such ... that** 这样的形式，**that**通常可以省略。

> The book was **so good (that)** I couldn't put it down.
>
> It was **suck a good book (that)** I couldn't put it down.

---

**so** 和**such** 有"like this"的意思。

>
> I didn't reliase it was **such an old house**.

---

## 103. Enough and too

**enough** 放在形容词和副词后面：

> I can't run very **far**. I'm not **fit enough**.
>
> Let's go. We've waited **long enough**.



比较**too**和**not enough**:

> You never stop working. You work **too hard**.（超出预期）
>
> You're lazy. You **don't** work **hard enough**.（低于预期）

---

**enough**放在名词前面：

> I can't run very far. I don't have **enough energy**.

**enough** 单独使用：

> We don't need to stop for petrol. We're got **enough**.

比较**too much/many**和**enough**的区别：

> There's **too much furniture** in this room. There's not **enough space**.
>
> There were **too many people** and not **enough chairs**.

---

**enough/too ... for ** +  somebody/something:

> Does Joe have enough experience **for the job**?
>
> That shirt is **too** small **for you**. You need a larger size.

但是**enough/too ... too**只能 + do something:

> Does Joe have enough experience **to do the job**?
>

同时用**for**和**to**:

## 104. Quite, pretty, rather and fairly

**quite/pretty/rather/fairly** 可以加形容词或副词：

> It's **quite cold**
>
> It's **rather cold**.

**quite/pretty/rather/fairly**的强度比`very`小，但是比`a little`大。

---

**quite**和**pretty**有相同的意思。

pretty是非正式的单词，主要用在口语中。

**quite**用在**a/an**前面，**pretty**则放在后面。

> Sarah has **quite a** good job.
>
> Sarah has **a pretty** good job.

**quite**还有其他用法，但是不适用**pretty**。

**quite a/an** + 名词:

> I didn't expect to see them. It was **quite a surprise**.

**quite a lot (of ...)**:

> There were **quite a lot of** people at the meeting.

**quite** + 动词，尤其是**like**和**enjob**:

> I **quite like** tennis, but it's not my favourite sport.

---

**rather**和**quite、pretty**很像，一般用在消极的地方。

> The weather isn't so good. It's **rather cloudy**.
>
> Paul is **rather shy**. He doesn't talk very much.

当**rather**用在积极的句子里面时，有'unusually'和'suprisingly'的意思。

> These oranges are **rather good**. Where did you get them?

---

**Fairly**语气比**quite/rather/pretty**要弱。如果我们说什么东西**fairly good**，有这个东西还不够好的意思。

> My room is **fairly big**, but I'd prefer a bigger one.

---

**quite**有 completely 的意思：

> 'Are you sure?' 'Yes, **quite sure**.'
>
> I **quite agree** with you.
>
> They **haven't quite finished** eating yet.





## 105. 比较1 Comparision1 (cheaper, more expensive etc.)

一个音节的单词后面加+ **er**：

> cheap -> cheaper
>
> fast -> faster
>
> lager -> lager

两个音节并且以**y**结尾的单词后面+ **er **(-y -> ier):

> lucky -> luckier
>
> early -> earlier
>
> easy -> easier

其他都用**more**。

有些形容词两种方式都可以用：

`clever`,`narrow`,`quite`,`shallow`,`simple`

---

下面是不规则的变换：

> good/well -> better
>
> bad/badly -> worse
>
> far -> further (or farther)



## 106. 比较2 Comparision2 (much bettr/ any better/ better and better/ the sooner the better)

在比较级前面可以用这些单词： **much**,**a lot**, **far**, **a bit**, **a little**, **slightly** :

---

可以用 **any**和**no** + 比较级：

> I've waited long enough. I'm not waiting **any longer**.
>
> How do you feel now? Do you feel **any better**?

---

**Better and better/ more and more**，重复比较级来表示某事持续不断的在变化。

> Your English is improving. It's getting **better and better**.
>
> The city has grown fast in recent years. It's got **bigger and bigger**.

---

**The ... the ...**

> **the sooner the better**
>
> **the bigger the better**

表示一件事情依赖另外一件事情：

> **The warmer** the weather, **the better** I feel.
>
> **The sooner** we leaver, **the earlier** we will arrive.

---

**older和elder**

**older和elder**可以用来表达家庭成员，比如：

> **My elder sister** is a TV producer. (or My **older** sister ...)

但是我们可以说`my elder sister`，不能说`somebody is elder`。



## 107. 比较级3 Comparison 3 (as ... as /than)

**not as ... (as)**

> Jack **isn't as old as** he looks. (= he looks **older than** he is)

**not so ... (as)**

> It's not warm, but it is**n't so** cold **as** yesterday.

**Less ... than** 和not as ... as 很像：

> I spent **less** money **than** you. (= I **didn't** spend **as** much money **as** you)
>
> I play tennis **less than** I used to.

---

**as ... as**

> I'm sorry I'm late. I got here **as fast as** I could.

>
> He's not as clever **as she is**.

## 108. 最高级 Superlatives (the longest/ the most enjoyable etc.)



最高级也是两种形式 **-est**或**most**，规则和比较级一样。

不规则的单词：

>
> bad -> worst
>
> far -> furthest/farthest

---

一般在最高级前面加**the**

> Yesterday was **the hottest** day of the year.

---

**oldest**和**eldest**

略

---

最高级和地点一起用，后面加**in**

对于组织或者一群人，也用**in**

时间用**of**

> Yesterday was the hottest day **of the year**?

在最高级后面用 过去分词：

> That was **the best** holiday **I've had** for a long time.



## 109. Word order1: verb + object; place and time

顺序：谓语+宾语 + (地点或时间)



## 110. Word order 2: adverbs with the verb

如果动词是一个单词，副词用在动词前面。

> Lucy **hardly ever watches** television and **rarely reads** newspapers.

副词用在be动词后面

> The traffic **isn't usually** as bad as it was this morning.

---

如果动词有2个单词及以上（can remember/ doesn't eat），副词放在第一个单词的后面。

> You**'ve always been** very kind to me.
>
> Jack can't cook. He **can't even boil** an egg.
>
> The concert **will probably be** cancelled.

**probably**在否定句中放在前面：

> I **probably won't see** you.

---

**all**和**both**同理。

---

有时候我们用**is/will/did**来避免重复(unit 51)。这个时候副词放在动词前面。

> He always says he won't be late, but he **always is**.
