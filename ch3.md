## 38 If I do ... and If I did ...

> Lisa: Shall we go by bus or by train?
>
> JESS: **If we go** by bus, it **will** be cheaper.

if + do 表示可以发生的事情。

> JOE:How are you going to travel?
>
> JESS:We're going by train. **If we went** by bus, it **would** be cheaper, but the train is quicker.

if + past 用来表示我们认为不会发生，或者我们不希望发生的事情。但是不表示过去时。



一般**would**不出现在**if**那部分的句子中。比如：

> **If** we **went** by bus, it would be cheaper. (not If we would go)

但是可以使用**if ... would** 去要求某人做某事。比如：

> I would be grateful **if** you **would let** me know your decision as soon as possible.



另外一部分（非if的部分）我们一般用would和would't，could和might也可以用。



## 39. If I knew ... I wish I knew ...

> **If I knew** his number, I **would phone** him.

**If I knew**  表示不知道号码。同样情况适用于**I wish**.



## 40. If I had known ...   I wish I had known ...

我们用**If + had**表示过去。

> I didn't see you when you passed me in the street. **If I'd seen** you, of course I would have said hello. (but I didn't see you)

**would**不写在**if**的部分，写在另外一个部分。

同理**wish**。

> I **wish I'd known**  that Gary was ill. I would have gone to see him. (but I didn't know)

不用在**wish**后面用**would have**.

> The weather was cold when we were on holiday. I wish it **had been** warmer. (not I wish it would have been)

比较**would (do)** 和**would have (done)**.前者表示现在时，后者表示过去时。

> If I'd gone to the party last night, I **would be** tired now. (I am not tired now -present)
>
> If I'd gone to the party last night, I **would have met** lots of people. (I didn't meet lots of people - past)

比较 **would have**， **could have**和**might have**：

If the weather hadn't bean so bad,

> we **would have gone** out.
>
> we **could have gone** out. (= we would have been able to go out)
>
> we **might have gone** out. (= perhaps we would have gone out)



## 41. Wish

> **I wish** you **a pleasant stay** here.
>
> **I hope** you **have** a pleasant stay here. (not I wish you have)

我们可以说 `wish somebody something`，但是不能说`I wish that something happends`，在这种情况下我们要用**hope**.

---

用**wish**来表示后悔做某事。

> I **wish** I **knew** what to do about the problem. (I don't know and I regret this)

用**wish + had** 来表示过去后悔做某事。

> I **wish** I**'d known** about the party. I would have gone if I'd known. (I didn't know)

---

**I wish I could** (**do** something)  表示后悔做做不到的事情。

> I'm sorry I have to go. I **wish** I **could stay** longer. (but I can't)

**I wish I could have** (**done** something) 表示过去.

> I hear the party was great. I **wish** I **could have gone**. (but I couldn't go)

---

可以使用`I wish (somebody) would (do something)`:

> It's been raining all day. Tanya doesn't like it. She says: **I wish** it **would stop** raining.

---

使用**I wish ...would**用来抱怨某个事情：

> The phone has been ringing for five minutes. **I wish** somebody **would answer** it.
>
> **I wish** you**'d do** something instead of just sitting and doing nothing.

使用**I wish ... wouldn't** 来抱怨人们重复做的事情。

> **I wish** you **wouldn't keep** interrupting me.

我们使用**I wish ...  would** 来表示我们希望事情发生，但是我们不用它来表示how we would like things to be (这个没有理解)。比较：

> I **wish** somebody **would buy** me a car.
>
> I **wish** I **had** a car. (not I wish I would have)
