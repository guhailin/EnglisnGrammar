## 92. 关系从句 Relative clauses 1:(clauses with who/that/which)

> The woman **who lives next door** is a doctor.

**who lives next door** 叫做关系从句。

可以用**that**替代**who**，但是有些时候必须要用**who**来用作人（unit 95）。

---

讨论事物时，在关系从句总用**that**或**which**。

> I don't like stories **that have unhappy endings**.

**That**用的比**which**多，但是有些时候必须用**which**.(unit 95)

---

**What** = 'the thing(s) that'

> **What happened** was my fault. (= the things happened)



## 93. 关系从句 Relative clauses2: clauses with and without who/that/which

在关系从句中，如果**who/that/which**是主语，不能省略；如果是宾语，则可以省略。

> The woman **who** lives next door is a doctor.

这里从句 `the woman lives next door`，`the woman`是主语，所以**who**在关系子句中是主语，所以这个who不能省略。

> The woman **who I wanted to see** was away on holiday.

这里从句`I wanted to see the woman`，`the woman`是宾语，所以**who**可以省略。

> **The woman I wanted to see** was away.

---

注意介词**in/to/for**在关系子句中的位置：

> Do you know the woman (who/that) Tom is **talking to**?

## 94. Relvative clauses 3: whose/whom/where

**whose**在关系子句中替代 **his/her/their**.

> we helped some people - **their** car had broken down.
>
> We helped some people **whose car had broken down**.

---

**whom**可用来替代宾语中的**who**：

> George is a person **whom I admire** very much.

**whom**还可以跟介词一起用:

> I like the people **with whom I work**.

**Whom**是一个正式的单词，我们一般不怎么用。我们经常偏好用**who**，**that**或直接省略。

---

当关系子句是在讨论地点时，我们用**where**：

> The restaurant **where we had lunch** was near the airport.

---

> **The last time (that) I saw Anna**, she looked great.

---

> **The reason I'm phoning** is to ask your advice.



## 95 Relative clauses 4: extra information clauses(1)

|                                                              |                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The woman **who lives next door** is a doctor                | My brother Ben, **who lives in Hong Kong**, is an architect. |
| 关系从句告诉你具体的人或事。The woman **who lives next door**告诉我们具体是哪个woman。 | My brother已经知道是谁了，关系从句告诉你额外信息。           |
| 不用逗号。                                                   | 用逗号。                                                     |
| 可以用that替代。who/which/that可以省略。                     | 不能用that替代。**who**或者**which**不能省略。               |
| 可以用whose和where                                           | 可以用whose和where                                           |



## 96. Relatie clauses 5: extra information clauses(2)

介词 + **whom/which**

> Mr Lee, **to whom** I spoke at the meeting, is very interested in our proposal

在非正式英语中，我们经常将介词放在动词后面，所以我们用**who**：

> This is muy friend from Canada, **who** I was telling you **about**.

---

**All of / most of** etc. + **whom/ which**

比较下面两个句子：

> Helen has three brothers. All of **them** are married. (2个句子)
>
> Helen has three brothers, **all of whom** are married. (1个句子)

> They asked me a lot of questions. I couldn't answer most of **them**. (2个句子)
>
> They asked me a lot of questions, **most of which** I couldn't answer. (1个句子)

同样的还有 `none of`,`neither of`,`any of`,`either of`,`some of`,`many of`,`much of`,`a few of`,`both of`,`half of`,`each of`,`one of`,`two of`,`the cause of`,`the name of`.

> They have three cars, **two of which** they rarely use.
>
> We stayed at a beautiful hotel, **the name of which** I can't remember now.

---

**which**

> Joe got the job, **which** surprised everybody.

这里wich = `the fact that he got the job`.



## 97. -ing and -ed clauses (the woman talking to Tom, the boy injured in the accident)

用**-ing**子句来说某人在这个特殊时间正在做某事。

> Do you know the woman **talking to Tom**? (the woman **is taling** to Tom)
>
> I was woken up by a bell **ringing**. (a bell **was ringing**.)

**-ing**子句也可以表示一直发生的事情。

> The road **connecting the two villages** is very narrow. (the road **connects** the two villages)
>
> Can you think of the name of a flower **beginning with T**? (the name **begins** with T)

---

**-ed**子句有被动的意思。

> The boy **injured in the accident** was taken to hospital. (he **was injured** in the accident)

但是要注意要用动词的过去分词。

> The police never found the money **stolen in the robbery**.

在这种方式下用**left**，表示“没有使用个，任然存在”的意思。

We've eaten nearly all the chocolates. There are only a few **left**.

---

**-ing**子句和**-ed**子句经常用在 **there is/ there was**后面。

> **There were** some children **swimming** in the river.
>
> **Is there** anybody **waiting**?
