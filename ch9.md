## 85. some and any

一般情况下我们在肯定句中用**some**(包括somebody/someone/something)，在反问句中用**any**(包括anybody等).

> We bought **some** flowers.
>
> We didn't by **any** flowers.

**any**也可以用在具有否定意思的句子中。

> She went out **without any** money.

---

在问句中，**some**和**any**都有用。

**some**一般用在讨论我们比较确定的人或者事情上，比如：

> Are you waiting for **somebody**? （我认为你一定是在等一个人）

当提供或者要求东西是，也用**some**：

> Would you like **something** to eat?
>
> Can I have **some** sugar, please?

但是在绝大多数问句中，我们都用**any**，因为我们不确定：

> 'Do you have **any** luggage?' 'No, I don't'
>
> I can't find my bag. Has **anybody** seen it?

---

**any**用在**if**后面：

> **If anyone** has **any** questions, I'll be pleased to answer them.

甚至有**if**意思的句子：

> I'm sorry for **any** trouble I've caused. (= if I have caused any trouble)

---

**any**用在表示"无所谓"意思的句子中：

> You can take **any** bus. They all go to the centre. (= it doesn't matter which bus you take)

---

**Somebody/someone/anybody/anyone**后面用单数的单词形式，但是表示的意思不是单数。

> **Someone** is here to see you.
>
> **Someone** has forgotten **their** umbrella.
