> Are you looking forward **to going** on holiday?

## 61. Be/get used to something (I'm used to ...)

## 64 To ..., for ... and so that ...

todo



## 65

todo



## 66 

todo



## 67 See somebody do and see somebody doing

如何说看到别人做了什么事情。

---

`Somebody **did** something` + `I saw this` = `I **saw** somebody **do** something`.

Tom got into his car and drove away. You saw this. You can say:

> I saw Tom **get** into his car and **drive** away.

被动形式：

> He was seen **to** get in the car.

---

`Somebody **was doing** something` + `I saw this` = `I **saw** somebody **doing** something`

Yesterday you saw Kate. She was waiting for a bus. You can say:

> I saw Kate **waiting** for a bus.

---

**两者的区别**

`I saw him **do** something` 表示我看了完整的过程。

`I saw hime **doing** something` 表示我没有看到完整的过程，只看到过程中间的动作。

有时候这个区别不是很重要，两者都可以用。

---

`see`,`hear`,`notice`,`smell`等一些单词都可以用这样的形式。



## 68. -ing clauses (Feeling tired, I went to bed early.)

Joe was playing football. He hurt his knee.

> Joe hurt his knee **playing football**.

You were feeling tired. So you went to bed early.

> **Feeling tired**, I went to bed early.

这里**Playing football** 和**feeling tired**被称作 **-ing**  子句。

如果ing子句写在句子的开头（就像上面的第二句），我们需要在后面写一个(,)。

---

如果两个事情同时发生，我们可以用ing子句。

> Kate is in the kitch **making coffee**. (= She is in the kitchen and she is making coffee)
>
> A man ran out of the house **shouting**. (= he ran out of the house and he was shouting)

当一个动作发生在另一个动作的时段中间，我们可以用ing子句（时间长的动作用ing子句）：

> Joe hurt his knee **playing football**. (= while he was playing)
>
> Did you cut yourself **shaving**? (= while you were shaving)

ing子句也可以用在**while**和**when**之后：

> Joe hurt his knee **while playing** football.

---

当一个动作发生在另一个动作之前，我们可以用**having (dong)**来表示第一个动作：

> **Having found** a hotel, we looked for somewhere to have dinner.
>
> **Having finished** her work, she went home.

 也可以用**after -ing**来表示：

> **After finishing** her work, she went home.

当一个短的动作之后马上接了另外短的动作，我们可以用**-ing**来替代**having done**：

> **Taking** a key out of his pocket, he opended the dorr.

这个结构在书面英语中用的比较多。

---

**-ing** 子句有解释的作用。

> **Feeling** tired, I went to bed early. (= beccause I felt tired)
