**Just in case**用来表示概率更小的事件。

**unless** = except if  (除非)

**unless = if ... not**

**As long as/ so long as/ provided/ providing** 这些短语都是**假如、如果**( `if`或者`on condition that`)的意思。

> You can borrow my car **as long as/ so long as** you promise not to drive too fast.
>

当你在表达未来时，不要在**unless/as long as/so long as/provided/providing** 后面用**will**：

>
> **Providing** the weather **is** good, we're going to have a picnic tomorrow.  (not providing the weather will be good)



## 116. As (As I walked along the street ... / As I was hungry ...)

也可以用 **as you were doing** :

> Kates slipped **as she was getting off** the bus.

**just as** = exactly at that moment.

> **Just as** I sat down, the doorbell rang.

**as**也可以用来表示两段较长时间的动词同时发生：

> **As** the day went on, the weather got worse.
>
> I began  enjoy the job more **as** I got used to it.

**as**和**when**的区别, **as**用在两件事情同时发生，**when**是用在一件事情发生在另一件之后：

> **As I drove home**, I listened to music. (= at the same time)
>
> **When I got home**, I had something to eat. (not As I got home)

---

**As** = because
